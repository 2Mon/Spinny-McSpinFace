# Began designing the frame 

In this first session, I looked at a bunch of different horizontal spinner battlebots (think Tombstone, etc), and learned about decoupling motors from the weapons with belts. I started cadding the frame and plates for the bot as well, deciding on a rough size and layout for the components. I took inspiration from Scalar, another antweight horizontal spinner, for the carbon fiber TPU sandwich that should give me a good ballance of rigidity and impact resistance. I have attatched photos of both Scalar and my current frame design.

In the second photo you can see the location for the wheel motors as well as the weapon motor. I plan to attatch the weapon motor to a belt and then connect it to the horizontal spinner which is mounted to the front hole.
